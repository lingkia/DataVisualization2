          Because fossil fuels continue to account for a sizable amount of the world's energy production and because we anticipate that they will result in high death tolls, 
          we cannot simply compare the total number of deaths from each source.
          <br><br>
          We contrast them instead based on the anticipated number of fatalities per unit of electricity. This is measured in terawatt hours. 
          This covers instances involving the supply chain and fatalities from air pollution.Take a look at this comparison in the chart on the left. 
          Biomass and fossil fuels result in more fatalities per unit of electricity than contemporary nuclear and renewable energy. Coal is by far the dirtiest fuel.

        Nuclear power, wind power, solar electricity, and the majority of hydropower are all low carbon energy sources. 
        The term only refers to a restricted subset of functioning fossil fuel power systems, specifically those that are successfully connected with a flue gas carbon capture and storage (CCS) system, and primarily excludes conventional fossil fuel plant sources.
        In 2020, around 40% of the world's electricity was produced using low-carbon sources, with roughly 10% coming from nuclear power, almost 10% from wind and solar energy, and about 20% from hydropower and other renewable sources.
